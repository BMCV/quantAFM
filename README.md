Project "Biomedical Image Analysis"

Automated analysis of atomic force microscopy images of wildtype and mutant nucleosomes.

Parameters defined so far:
- ratio of unbound DNA / nucleosomes
- length of unbound DNA
- length of nucleosome-bound DNA
- position of nucleosomes (ratio of length of both DNA arms)
- opening angle between both arms of nucleosome-bound DNA
