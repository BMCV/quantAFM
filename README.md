# quantAFM #

This project contains the project of an automated analysis of atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of wildtype and mutant nucleosomes.

**Parameters** defined so far:

- ratio of unbound DNA / nucleosomes
- length of unbound DNA
- length of nucleosome-bound DNA
- position of nucleosomes (ratio of length of both DNA arms)
- opening angle between both arms of nucleosome-bound DNA


This project is originally stemming from a course project at Heidelberg University, jointly conducted by Computer Scienctists and Molecular Bioscientists. Feel free to take a look at the initial report for a closer investigation of the architecture.
Note that the current state of the project differs significantly from this, but might serve as an intermediate starting point. Additionally `config.m` contains a thorough description of the provided code options.
