For future work, there are some things to explore:
- imfindcircles() lists a cryptic line in their description:
  "imfindcircles preprocesses binary (logical) images to improve the accuracy of the result. 
   converts truecolor images to grayscale using the function rgb2gray before processing them."
  This could mean that we could get potentially better results if we preprocess the images
  by overlaying the grayscale image with the binary mask, and then run it on that image.

- The re-estimation of the length is currently done based on a very crude method,
  and could potentially be improved by using a kind of "point mirror" approach
  on the last pixel. Then again, there are probably other ways to do this, too.

- Only export a certain value range of lengths for different filaments.
