% WARNING: All of the following is only for experienced users/developers

% The threshold algorithms used in the three step thresholding algorithm,
% more information in the project report, commonly used are 'otsu' and
% 'moments', other Matlab algorithms did not work for our dataset
threshAlgorithm1 = 'otsu'; % Default: 'otsu'
threshAlgorithm2 = 'otsu'; % Default: 'otsu'
% Upper bound for background noise, every value that is <=
% backgroundThreshold is considered background
backgroundThreshold = 95; % Default: 95


% Additionally, you can specify the used algorithm for length determination
% lengthAlgo = 'C'; % default arbitrary
lengthAlgo = 'D';


% determine whether the output is "real-valued" (in nm), or "pixel-valued"
realValue = 1; % default is 1 = real value
% realValue = 0; % this is pixel values
